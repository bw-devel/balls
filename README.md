# **Balls**

An attempt at an idle/incremental game based on Pachinko...

---

## Concept

Using Pincremental as an base concept, have an incremental/idle game that
builds off of auto-playing Pachinko game that can potentially split of to
multiple tables?


## Controls

| Control     | Effect                    |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------:|
| p           | toggles the debug overlay |
| space       | pause/un-pause simulation |
| q           | quits game                |
| r           | reset objects             |
